# azure-function-graphql-typescript-starter

Typescript starter for a HTTP-triggered GraphQL Azure Function. Built on top of:

- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/azure-functions/)
  with Azure Functions integration
- [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) to make developing GraphQL APIs simple
  and fun
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as persistence layer
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) for database migrations and useful repository
  classes

Develop and test your API locally and deploy to Azure with confidence.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 12 (it may very well work with earlier versions but I targeted the
  latest version supported by Azure at the moment)
- Docker to start a Postgres server locally
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools)
  v3

### Installing

Define database connection details as environment variables in `.env` file
(change the port if you already have another Postgres instance running on
`5432`)

```text
Copy .env.example to .env
```

Start a local Postgres instance

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Install npm dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

## Getting Started

### Entities

Create your entities and define GraphqQL- and persistence-specific bits with
Typescript decorators.

[Entities in TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/docs/types-and-fields.html) |
[Entities in TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/entities)

Starter code includes 1 entity to get you started:

`graphql/entities/Post.ts`

```typescript
import {
  Entity,
  Column,
  PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
  UpdateDateColumn,
  CreateDateColumn,
} from 'typeorm'
import { ObjectType, Field } from 'type-graphql'

@ObjectType()
@Entity({ name: 'posts' })
export class Post {
  @Field(() => Int)
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number

  @Field()
  @Column()
  title: string

  @Field()
  @Column()
  description: string

  @Field()
  @CreateDateColumn({ type: 'timestamptz' })
  createdAt: Date

  @UpdateDateColumn({ type: 'timestamptz' })
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Migrations

Whenever you create new or update an existing entity, generate a migration file
with SQL queries needed to take your database structure from its current state
to the new state (defined by entities).
[TypeORM Migrations](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations)

```sh
npm run migrations:generate -- 'your-migration-name'
```

Starter code has 1 migration which creates a table for the `Post` entity:

`graphql/migrations/1604267700406-posts.ts`

```typescript
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm'

export class posts1604267700406 implements MigrationInterface {
  name = 'posts1604267700406'

  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(
      `CREATE TABLE "posts" (
        "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
        "title" character varying NOT NULL,
        "description" character varying NOT NULL,
        "created_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
        "updated_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
        CONSTRAINT "PK_2829ac61eff60fcec60d7274b9e" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
      )`,
    )
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "posts"`)
  }
}
```

Review your migration at `graphql/migrations/xxxx-your-migration-name.ts` and
run it:

```sh
npm run migrations:run
```

![npm run migrations:run](./docs/img/npm-run-migrations.png)

### Resolvers

Create resolvers supporting the logic of your application. Get some input, do
the processing and database fetches/updates and return some data.
[Resolvers in TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/docs/resolvers.html)

Starter code has 1 resolver which consists of a `posts()` query and a
`createPost(title, description)` mutation:

`graphql/resolvers/PostResolver.ts`

```typescript
import { Arg, Ctx, Mutation, Query, Resolver } from 'type-graphql'
import { Post } from '../entities/Post'
import { AppContext } from '../util/azure'

@Resolver()
export class PostResolver {
  @Query(() => [Post])
  async posts(@Ctx() { conn }: AppContext): Promise<Post[]> {
    return await conn.getRepository(Post).find()
  }

  @Mutation(() => Post)
  async createPost(
    @Arg('title') title: string,
    @Arg('description') description: string,
    @Ctx() { conn }: AppContext,
  ): Promise<Post> {
    const repo = conn.getRepository(Post)
    const post = repo.create()

    post.title = title
    post.description = description

    await repo.save(post)

    return post
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Server

Start your application:

```sh
npm run start
```

It will start a local Azure Functions emulator (check the console output for
some useful debugging information). It will also watch for changes in your
Typescript files and reload the server as necessary.

![npm run start](./docs/img/npm-run-start.png)

Alternatively you can run/debug the function in VS Code, for that you'd need to
install
[Azure Functions for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions)

### GraphQL Client

Make some requests to verify the server is working properly.

You can either use a built-in GraphQL Playground
([http://localhost:7071/graphql](http://localhost:7071/graphql))

![GraphQL Playground](./docs/img/graphql-playground.png)

Or something more old-fashioned like curl:

```sh
 ï£¿ ~ $ curl \
> -X POST \
> -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
> --data '{ "query": "{ posts { id title } }" }' \
> http://localhost:7071/graphql
{"data":{"posts":[{"id":1,"title":"My first post"}]}}
```

### Coding Style & Linter

Make sure code passess all correctness checks and is properly formatted.

Make sure docs are valid Markdown.

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Security Checks

Make sure there are no known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

```sh
npm run audit-security
```

### CI

Linter and security checks will be triggered on new PRs as part of Github CI.

## Deploy to Azure

We're not focusing on the way you set up Postgres in the cloud. You can spin up
a VM and install the database server manually or use a managed instance from any
of the cloud providers.

Couple ways to deploy your code to Azure:

- [Deploying the project to Azure using the Azure CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/azure-functions/#deploying-the-project-to-azure-using-the-azure-cli)
- [Deploying to Azure from VS Code](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/azure-functions/#deploying-to-azure-from-vs-code)

Once deployed, set database connection environment variables in Azure Function
App configuration.

- [Manage your function app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings)

## Cleanup

Stop and remove local Postgres Docker container with data volumes:

```sh
docker-compose down --volumes
```
